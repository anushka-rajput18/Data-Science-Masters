    "- **Data loss**: If a file is not closed after writing data to it, there is a risk that the data will not be saved. This can occur if the program crashes or the system shuts down unexpectedly. By closing the file after writing data to it, the data is saved to the file and can be retrieved later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File corruption**: If a file is not closed after writing data to it, the file may become corrupted if the system crashes or the program terminates unexpectedly. This can lead to data loss and make the file unusable.\n",
